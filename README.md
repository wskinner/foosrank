FoosRank
========

FoosRank is a leaderboard for Foosball matches (or any competitive game) that 
updates in real time using websockets. 

Players report match results by tweeting a terse description of the outcome, 
e.g. "@foozbot 49ers 17 Seahawks 23. 

Player rankings are determined using the Elo scoring algorithm.
